How to run the program?

    1) Down all the files in the project folder.
    2) Make sure input files "trace.txt", "vector_table.txt" and "device_table.txt"in the same folder as "interrupts.c" and "interrupts.h".
    3) Navigate to the project folder where all the files are. 
    4) Open the terminal from that folder.
    5) run the command:
        gcc interrupts.c -o interrupts
    6) Then, run the command:
        ./interrupts trace.txt vector_table.txt device_table.txt
    7) a file named "execution.txt" with the simulation result should be produced in the project folder.
