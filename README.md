How to run the program?

    1) Make sure input files "trace.txt", "vector_table.txt" and "device_table.txt"in the same folder as "interrupts.c" and "interrupts.h".
    2) Navigate to the project folder where all the files are. 
    3) Open the terminal from that folder.
    4) run the command:
        gcc interrupts.c -o interrupts
    5) Then, run the command:
        ./interrupts trace.txt vector_table.txt device_table.txt
    6) a file named "execution.txt" with the simulation result should be produced in the project folder.
